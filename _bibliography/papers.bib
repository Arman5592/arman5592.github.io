  abstract = {To alleviate costly data communication among processing cores and memory modules, parallel processing-in-memory (PIM) is a promising approach which exploits the huge available internal memory bandwidth. High capacity, wide row size, and maturity of DRAM technology, make DRAM an alluring structure for PIM. However, dense layout, high process variation, and noise vulnerability of DRAMs make it very challenging to apply PIM for DRAMs in practice. This work proposes a PIM structure which eliminates these DRAM limitations, exploiting a precharge-free DRAM (PF-DRAM) structure. The proposed PIM structure, called PIPF-DRAM, performs parallel bitwise operations only by modifying control signal sequences in PF-DRAM, with almost zero structural and circuit modifications. Comparing the state-of-the-art PIM techniques, PIPF-DRAM is 4.2\texttimes{} more robust to process variation, 4.1\% faster in average cycle time of operations, and consumes 66.1\% less energy.},

  abstract = {DRAM is the most mature and widely-utilized memory structure as main memory in computing systems. However, energy dissipation and latency of DRAM are two of the most serious limiting factors of this technology. All DRAM main operations are initiated by a Precharge phase, which is time-consuming and power-hungry. This work proposes a novel DRAM cell access scheme that entirely eliminates Precharge phase from DRAM read, write, and refresh operations, with a very slight modification in commodity DRAM structure. The proposed DRAM design, called CoolDRAM, operates using a single extra cell row as reference cells. CoolDRAM reduces energy dissipation by about 34% on average, with a negligible area overhead of about 0.4%. The robustness of CoolDRAM against process variation and environmental noises is 61× and 1.78 × of the state-of-the-art, respectively, while maintaining the same power consumption and latency.},
