  abstract = {To alleviate costly data communication among processing cores and memory modules, parallel processing-in-memory (PIM) is a promising approach which exploits the huge available internal memory bandwidth. High capacity, wide row size, and maturity of DRAM technology, make DRAM an alluring structure for PIM. However, dense layout, high process variation, and noise vulnerability of DRAMs make it very challenging to apply PIM for DRAMs in practice. This work proposes a PIM structure which eliminates these DRAM limitations, exploiting a precharge-free DRAM (PF-DRAM) structure. The proposed PIM structure, called PIPF-DRAM, performs parallel bitwise operations only by modifying control signal sequences in PF-DRAM, with almost zero structural and circuit modifications. Comparing the state-of-the-art PIM techniques, PIPF-DRAM is 4.2\texttimes{} more robust to process variation, 4.1\% faster in average cycle time of operations, and consumes 66.1\% less energy.},

  abstract = {DRAM is the most mature and widely-utilized memory structure as main memory in computing systems. However, energy dissipation and latency of DRAM are two of the most serious limiting factors of this technology. All DRAM main operations are initiated by a Precharge phase, which is time-consuming and power-hungry. This work proposes a novel DRAM cell access scheme that entirely eliminates Precharge phase from DRAM read, write, and refresh operations, with a very slight modification in commodity DRAM structure. The proposed DRAM design, called CoolDRAM, operates using a single extra cell row as reference cells. CoolDRAM reduces energy dissipation by about 34% on average, with a negligible area overhead of about 0.4%. The robustness of CoolDRAM against process variation and environmental noises is 61× and 1.78 × of the state-of-the-art, respectively, while maintaining the same power consumption and latency.},

abstract = {The Three-Dimensional Network on Chip (3D NoC) is an interconnection architecture designed to address the increasing communication demands between processing cores. However, as traffic and power density continues to rise, efficient traffic management and thermal regulation within these chips have become crucial issues. One common problem encountered in mesh-based NoC structures, regardless of the routing approach employed, is traffic congestion in the central region. This paper introduces a novel routing algorithm named an Oblivious Congested Region Avoiding Routing Algorithm (OCRA) to evenly distribute packet flow across the entire network.OCRA addresses the traffic imbalance by statically configuring specific routers located in the east and west of each layer in a 3D NoC using YXZ and YZX and configuring other routers using XYZ. This configuration aims to minimize traffic congestion in the network, reduce total queuing delay and improve packet latency. The paper explores various configurations for OCRA, and simulation results on a cycle-accurate simulator indicate that a specific configuration known as Pyramidical achieves a 51.67\% improvement in traffic load distribution across the network. Additionally, this configuration reduces average queuing delay by 48.7\% and improves the performance of the saturated 3D NoC by 35.24\% with no impact on chip area.},
