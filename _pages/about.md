Hello! I'm Arman, an undergrad in computer engineering. I have a fondness for computer architecture, which stems from my middle-school passion for electronics and tinkering with Arduinos. My background mainly revolves around in-memory processing and memory architecture, alongside some experiences with embedded systems and FPGAs. In addition to these fields, I'm also interested in topics such as brain-inspired computer architectures and the systems/architectures for ML.
