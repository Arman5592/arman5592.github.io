Hello! I'm Arman, an undergrad in [computer engineering](https://ce.sharif.edu/) at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/). I have a fondness for computer architecture, which stems from my middle-school passion for electronics and tinkering with Arduinos.

My background mainly revolves around in-memory processing and memory architecture, on which I have two years of RA experience at [IPM](https://cs.ipm.ac.ir/). Moreover, I have some experience with FPGAs, including a summer internship at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), as well as hands-on experience with embedded systems.

In addition to these fields, I'm also interested in topics such as brain-inspired computer architectures, accelerators, and architectures for ML.
