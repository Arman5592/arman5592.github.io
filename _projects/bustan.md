A notebook that explores the classification of [Saadi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadi_Shirazi)'s poems' couplets between 10 classes (chapters of Bustan). Saadi was a Persian poet from the 13th century whose work gained fame for its moral themes. As part of the [advanced information retrieval course](https://language.ml/) we explored a classification problem on his work.
