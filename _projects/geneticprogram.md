[Corresponding repository](https://github.com/Arman5592/Genetic-Programming-Function-Approximation)

This is a minimalist genetic program which approximates a function (expression tree) from points (x, y).
The main goal has been simplicity, which has hindered the program's performance but makes the code easier to follow.
