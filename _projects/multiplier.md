A matrix-multiplier (as a simple accelerator) which uses block multiplication to increase parallelism. This design is built around a shared memory (FPGA's BRAM) which contains operands and the resulting matrix; Thus, matrices of any size can be multiplied (given that they fit inside the RAM and are multiplicable). The verilog description is meticulously examined with simulations, and a synthesis was also carried out (but my Spartan-6 couldn't fit the entire design ðŸ˜”).

I also extended this design for a graduate SoC course. The result was a matrix ALU which was synthesized in an ASIC workflow, and I plan on sharing it as soon as possible.
