[Corresponding repository](https://github.com/Arman5592/NeuralNetworks)

A course project, comprising three objectives.

In the first part, points are generated for a function `f(x)` and neural networks are explored as a means to approximate this function.

The second part included classifying MNIST and examining the effects of different parameters.

Finally, NNs are used as a means of de-noising samples of MNIST (to which gaussian and salt noise was added) and this method is explored thoroughly.

The repository contains code and more explanations.
