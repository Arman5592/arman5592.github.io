Based on a [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) using the [Arduino](https://arduino-pico.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) ecosystem and [Edge Impulse](https://edgeimpulse.com/), this is a tabletop clock that can display ambient humidity and temperature, and function as a 3D compass and an ultrasonic ruler. Moreover, it can play two games (a 2-player Pong or a single-player Chrome-dinosaur-esque jump-and-dash game with inspirations from Hollow Knight. Moving between game/clock functionalities is done by saying `yes` to the clock's microphone.
